# PCOS Detection

## Overview
The PCOS Detection project utilizes machine learning to accurately detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) through analysis of blood reports and ultrasound images. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve treatment planning.

## Features
- **Blood Report Analysis:** Leveraging blood test data to identify markers indicative of PCOS.
- **Ultrasound Image Analysis:** Utilizing advanced image processing to detect cysts and other abnormalities in ovarian ultrasound images.
- **Data Aggregation:** Combining data from multiple sources for comprehensive analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing state-of-the-art ML algorithms to ensure high accuracy in detection.
